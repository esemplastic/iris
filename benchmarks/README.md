## Benchmarks

Run the benchmarks by yourself and you will which is the faster framework out there.

1. Clone/Download the [https://github.com/kataras/go-http-routing-benchmark](https://github.com/kataras/go-http-routing-benchmark)
2. Open a terminal window inside the directory you saved it
3. Run go test -bench=. -timeout=60m


-------------------------------------------

**-bench=.** means run and print all tests 


**-timeout=60m** means override the default timeout which is 10m, give the tests their time, on my pc it finished at 971.163s



## Next

At this folder (iris/benchmarks) I will upload all the output window  to multiple images (it's a very long window)
